				<p>Continuing on from my house price predictor project below my next step was to use multiple variables instead of one to feed into my model.
					Again I used scikit learn to split these data sets up into training and test sets and then fit a line to the training set. 
					I then compared the predicted house price from the test set data to calculate an accuracy score of the model. 
					Finally I used the model to predict a house price when given the square feet of the house. 
					e.g Using this model a house with 1,750 square feet will be predicted to have the corresponding price of £425,000; as shown in the plot to the left.</p>

				<p>In order to become more familar with linear regression I decided to start off as simple as possible to build up my knowledge of the foundations and then slowly make the same project more complex.</p>
				<p>
					In order to keep it as simple as possible I decided to just use data for two houses with one variable which is the square feet of the house and the price as the target.  House 1: is a house with 1000 square feet(sqft) sold for £300,000. House 2: is a house with 2000sqft sold for £500,000.
					I then used the data points to work out the slope/ coefficent of the line and then used this to find the y intercept.
					Next I used the library Matplotlib to plot the line so that I could see visually the how the square feet and price were related.
					Finaly I was then able to use my model to make predictions. e.g Using this model a house with 1,200 square feet will be predicted to have the corresponding price of £340,000; as shown in the plot to the left.</p>

            <div class="style60" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Using Student Performance data from UCI Machine Learning repository I built a Linear Regression model to predict student final exam scores based on certain data about that student such as scores in previous tests and absence days.</p>
              <p>Step 1: I downloaded the data file, chose which features would likely be best indicators of a students success and then I had to format the data. <br>
				Step 2: I split the data into training and test data sets. I chose to seperate out 10% for the test data. <br>
				Step 3: Next I trained the model using scikit learn to find a "best-fit" line from the student data provided. I then compared the models predicted score with the actual score from the test set data to find an accurancy percentage. Based on this I played around with which student information I included in the model in order to increase the model accuracy score.<br>
				Step 4: Finally I create a small user interface where a user can type in details such as previous test scores and absenses of a student to get a prediction of their final year score. </p>

					<div class="style60" style="padding-left: 50px;">
					  <p>As part of a group project we were presented a scenario of a user who needed to be able to use an application that by inputting in a time and location of an incident would be presented back with who was known to have been in the area at this time.  As part of this project we were given lots of CSV files containing lots of dummy data including, names, addresses, call records, ATM and card transitions and vehicle registration sightings.       </p>
					  <p>We chose to use React for the frontend, Node.js and SQL for backend and deploy on AWS. My main focus was on Node.js and querying the database which took a lot of time and effort to get from the original data format onto a database and in a way that could be used on a relational database. We also used a Map API to take the coordinates returned from the backend to display the locations of activities on a map for the user to be able to easily interpret the data. This was a really enjoyable project and I learnt a lot from various aspects of development.       </p>
					  <p>To try out the tool you can use the example data Latitude: 52.70225113709832 Longitude: -2.0368518763076935 and Date and Time: 01/05/2015 09:08 as this is known to have relevant data associated with it in the database.  </p

					<div class="style60" style="padding-left: 50px;">
					  <p>The number of potential solutions to try in a given Sudoku puzzle is huge, using a backtracking algorithm enables a computer to solve a puzzle extremely quickly and efficiently.      </p>
					  <p>The code works by moving along the empty squares and provisionally allocating the first number that works given then numbers in the puzzle at that point in time. It then moves on to the next empty square.  As soon as it is realised that there is a square in which no number meets the requirements the algorithm moves back to the previously given provisional number and increases the provisional number to see if that satisfies the requirement.  This continues until the puzzle is solved.    </p>
					  <p>To attempted to solve the sudoku puzzle or watch the algorithm solve it for you click on the link below. Instructions - Click a box and hit the number on your keyboard to pencil in a number. To confirm that value press the ENTER key on that box. To delete a pencil in you can click DEL. Finally to solve the board press SPACE, sit back and watch the algorithm run.</p>
